If you are looking for a challenging and immersive strategy game, Battle For Troy might not be the best choice for you. But if you are looking for a casual and nostalgic game that lets you experience the Trojan War in a simplified way, you might find some fun in Battle For Troy. Just make sure you download it from a safe source like SKIDROW and don't expect too much from it.
  
Battle For Troy also has a multiplayer mode that allows you to play with up to 6 players online or via LAN. You can choose from 8 different maps and 4 different game modes: Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, and Trojan Horse. You can also customize your game settings, such as the starting resources, the population limit, and the victory conditions. The multiplayer mode can be a fun way to test your skills against other players and enjoy some cooperative or competitive gameplay.
 
However, the multiplayer mode also suffers from some of the same problems as the single-player mode. The game is prone to crashing, lagging, or disconnecting during online matches. The game also lacks a matchmaking system or a ranking system, so it can be hard to find players of your skill level or preference. The game also has some balance issues, as some units and heroes are much more powerful than others. The multiplayer mode can be frustrating and boring if you encounter these issues frequently.
 
Battle For Troy is a game that has some potential but fails to deliver on many aspects. It is a game that might appeal to some fans of historical strategy games or fans of the Trojan War mythos, but it is also a game that might disappoint or annoy many others. It is a game that you can download and play for free thanks to SKIDROW, but it is also a game that you might not want to waste your time or disk space on. It is a game that you can try for yourself and see if you like it or not.
