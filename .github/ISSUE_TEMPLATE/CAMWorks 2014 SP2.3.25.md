CAMWorks 2014 SP2.3.25 is a powerful and user-friendly CAM software that integrates with SOLIDWORKS and Solid Edge. It offers a wide range of machining capabilities, such as 2.5 Axis, 3 Axis, 4 Axis, 5 Axis, Turning, Mill-Turn, Wire EDM, and Nesting.
 
One of the new features introduced in CAMWorks 2014 SP2.3.25 is the Advanced 3 Axis Toolpath Generation Method[^1^]. This method allows you to generate smoother and more efficient toolpaths for complex 3D surfaces and solids. It also reduces the number of retractions and re-entries, resulting in shorter machining time and better surface finish.

In this article, we will show you how to use the Advanced 3 Axis Toolpath Generation Method in CAMWorks 2014 SP2.3.25 to create high-quality toolpaths for your 3D models.
 
## Step 1: Open your 3D model in SOLIDWORKS or Solid Edge
 
The first step is to open your 3D model in SOLIDWORKS or Solid Edge and make sure it is fully defined and error-free. You can use any of the supported file formats, such as SLDPRT, SLDASM, PAR, ASM, IGES, STEP, etc.
 
## Step 2: Launch CAMWorks and define your machine setup
 
The next step is to launch CAMWorks from the SOLIDWORKS or Solid Edge menu and define your machine setup. You can choose from a variety of predefined machines or create your own custom machine. You can also specify the stock material, coordinate system, tool crib, post processor, and other parameters for your machining operation.
 
## Step 3: Extract or create your multisurface features
 
The third step is to extract or create your multisurface features for 3 Axis machining. You can use the Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) function to automatically identify and extract the multisurface features from your model. Alternatively, you can use the Interactive Feature Recognition (IFR) function to manually select the surfaces or solids that you want to machine.
 
## Step 4: Generate operations and toolpaths using the Advanced Method
 
The fourth step is to generate operations and toolpaths for your multisurface features using the Advanced Method. You can do this by right-clicking on the feature in the CAMWorks Feature Tree and selecting Generate Operation Plan. Then, right-click on the operation and select Generate Toolpath.

Before generating the toolpath, you need to make sure that the Advanced Method is selected as the 3 Axis toolpath generation method. You can do this by opening the CAMWorks Options dialog box and going to the Update tab. In the 3 Axis toolpath generation method section, select Advanced Method[^1^]. Click OK to apply the settings and close the dialog box.
 
All 3 Axis toolpaths generated after these settings take effect will be generated using the Advanced Method[^1^]. You can also modify the parameters of each operation, such as cut pattern, stepover, cut depth, lead-in/out, etc., to suit your needs.
 
## Step 5: Simulate and verify your toolpaths
 
The final step is to simulate and verify your toolpaths before sending them to the machine. You can use the CAMWorks Simulation module to visualize the tool motion, check for collisions and gouges, measure distances and angles, and generate reports. You can also use the CAMWorks NC Editor module to view and edit the post-processed G-code[^2^].
 
## Conclusion
 
The Advanced 3 Axis Toolpath Generation Method in CAMWorks 2014 SP2.3.25 is a useful feature that can help you create smoother and more efficient toolpaths for complex 3D surfaces and solids. It can also reduce machining time and improve surface quality by minimizing retractions and re-entries.
