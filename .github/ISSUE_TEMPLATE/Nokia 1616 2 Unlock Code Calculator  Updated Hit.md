If you have a Nokia 1616-2 phone that is locked to a specific network or carrier, you might be wondering how to unlock it and use it with any SIM card. Fortunately, there is a simple and free way to do that, using a code calculator that can generate the unlock code for your phone based on its IMEI number.
 
The IMEI number is a unique 15-digit code that identifies your phone. You can find it by typing \*#06# on your phone's keypad or by looking at the sticker under the battery. Once you have the IMEI number, you can use an online code calculator like [NokiaFree](https://unlock.nokiafree.org/) or [UnlockItFree](https://www.unlockitfree.com/) to get the unlock code for your phone.
