# Linga Puranam in Tamil PDF Free Download - A Guide to the Ancient Scripture on Lord Shiva
  
Linga Puranam is one of the 18 major Puranas, or ancient Hindu scriptures, that narrate the glory and attributes of Lord Shiva, the supreme deity of Shaivism. The word "linga" means "mark" or "symbol" and refers to the iconic representation of Shiva as a phallus, which symbolizes his creative power and energy. The Linga Puranam consists of two parts, each containing about 6000 verses. The first part deals with the origin and manifestation of Shiva, his various forms and names, his worship and festivals, his sacred places and rivers, his consort Parvati and their sons Ganesha and Kartikeya, and his devotees and sages. The second part describes the cosmic dissolution and recreation, the four yugas or epochs, the dynasties of kings and sages, the laws of karma and dharma, and the benefits of reading and listening to the Linga Puranam.
  
The Linga Puranam is considered to be one of the oldest Puranas, dating back to at least the 5th century CE. It is also one of the most revered and popular Puranas among the Shaivites, as it extols the greatness and supremacy of Shiva over all other gods. The Linga Puranam contains many stories and legends that illustrate the various aspects and qualities of Shiva, such as his compassion, his fierceness, his grace, his austerity, his dance, his destruction, his benevolence, and his omniscience. The Linga Puranam also teaches the importance of devotion, service, ethics, meditation, yoga, mantra, and tantra for attaining liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

Shaivism is a rich and diverse tradition that encompasses various schools of thought, practices, and rituals. Some of the main branches of Shaivism are:

- Shaiva-siddhanta: This is the most prevalent and influential school of Shaivism in South India. It follows a dualistic philosophy that distinguishes between the supreme Lord Shiva, the individual soul, and the bonds that limit the soul's realization. It emphasizes the importance of grace, devotion, ethics, and ritual for attaining liberation.
- Kashmiri Shaivism: This is a form of monistic Shaivism that developed in Kashmir from the 9th to the 13th centuries CE. It holds that Shiva is the ultimate reality and the source of all creation. It teaches that the individual soul can realize its identity with Shiva through a process of spiritual awakening and transformation.
- Lingayat: This is a social and religious movement that originated in Karnataka in the 12th century CE under the leadership of Basava, a poet and reformer. It rejects the authority of the Vedas, the caste system, and the worship of idols. It affirms that Shiva is the only god and that he is present in every person as a linga, a symbol of his energy.
- Nath: This is an ascetic and mystical movement that traces its origins to Matsyendranatha and Gorakhnatha, two legendary yogis who lived between the 8th and 12th centuries CE. It focuses on the practice of hatha yoga, mantra, and alchemy for achieving physical and spiritual perfection.

Shaivism has also influenced and interacted with other Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaktism, Tantrism, and Bhakti. Shaivism has contributed to the development of art, literature, music, dance, architecture, and culture in India and beyond. Shaivism has also spread to other regions of Asia, such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Malaysia.
  
Shaivism is a living and dynamic tradition that continues to inspire millions of devotees across the world. Shaivites celebrate various festivals and observances in honor of Shiva, such as Maha Shivaratri, Pradosha, Shiva Ratri, and Kartik Purnima. Shaivites also visit various sacred sites associated with Shiva, such as Kashi, Kedarnath, Mount Kailash, Chidambaram, and Elephanta. Shaivites also seek the guidance and blessings of various saints and gurus who have embodied the spirit and teachings of Shiva.
